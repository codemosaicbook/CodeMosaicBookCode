# Chapter 4: Database Diaries: Chronicles of Structured Memories

Welcome to Chapter 4's practical exercises guide. This chapter delves into the essentials of databases, focusing on SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and SQL queries. Here, you'll find SQL files corresponding to each hands-on exercise, designed to provide a hands-on approach to learning database operations. Simply copy and paste the contents into your SQL query window in SSMS and start experimenting.

## Contents

- [Hands-On 1: Exploring SSMS](#hands-on-1-exploring-ssms)
- [Hands-On 2: Create a Database and Table](HandsOn2_TechFusionDB.sql)
- [Hands-On 3: Perform CRUD Operations](HandsOn3_EmployeesCRUD.sql)
- [Hands-On 4: Filter and Select Data](HandsOn4_FilterSelectData.sql)
- [Hands-On 5: Exploring Relationships and Schema Design](HandsOn5_RelationshipsSchemaDesign.sql)

### Hands-On 1: Exploring SSMS

For the first hands-on, we focus on familiarizing ourselves with the SSMS interface, exploring menu options, and executing a simple query. Since this exercise involves navigating through SSMS and does not involve running SQL scripts, there is no accompanying SQL file. The purpose is to get comfortable with the environment where you'll be executing all your future queries.

### SQL Files for Hands-On Exercises

Each of the following SQL files contains queries and comments that guide you through the specific tasks outlined in the exercises. These files are designed to be directly used within SSMS.

- **[Hands-On 2: Create a Database and Table](HandsOn2_TechFusionDB.sql)** - This file guides you through creating a new database named `TechFusionDB` and a table named `Employees`.
  
- **[Hands-On 3: Perform CRUD Operations](HandsOn3_EmployeesCRUD.sql)** - Contains queries to insert, retrieve, update, and delete records in the `Employees` table. This file now includes 10 sample INSERT statements to populate your table with data.
  
- **[Hands-On 4: Filter and Select Data](HandsOn4_FilterSelectData.sql)** - This file demonstrates how to execute queries to fetch specific columns, filter and sort data, and use SQL functions and clauses.
  
- **[Hands-On 5: Exploring Relationships and Schema Design](HandsOn5_RelationshipsSchemaDesign.sql)** - Focuses on creating tables with relationships, designing a schema for an e-commerce platform, and implementing data integrity checks.

## Getting Started

To get started, open SSMS, connect to your database server, and open a new query window. Copy the contents of the relevant SQL file from the list above into your query window and execute the queries to see the results. Feel free to modify and play around with the queries to explore more features and functionalities.

Happy Learning!
