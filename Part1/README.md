# Part 1: Foundation and Smart Techniques

Welcome to Part 1 of the "CodeMosaic" repository, titled "Foundation and Smart Techniques." This section lays the theoretical groundwork for understanding modern software development practices, with a focus on AI-driven development and modern best practices for the enterprise. While Part 1 is primarily theoretical, it includes practical code examples in select chapters to enhance learning and provide hands-on experience.

> **Note:** Before exploring the code examples in this repository, we strongly recommend reading through the corresponding chapters in the "CodeMosaic" book. This will ensure a comprehensive understanding and context for the practical examples provided here. Diving into the repository without prior knowledge from the book may result in confusion and a less cohesive learning experience.
