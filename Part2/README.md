# Part 2: Crafting the Mosaic

Welcome to Part 2 of the "CodeMosaic" repository, titled "Crafting the Mosaic." This section is dedicated to the hands-on development of an AI Dashboard Web Application, demonstrating the application of modern development practices in a full-stack project. The project is divided into a series of "Mosaic Tiles," each focusing on a specific aspect of the application's development, from ideation to deployment.

> **Note:** It is essential to have read the corresponding chapters in the "CodeMosaic" book before diving into this repository. The book provides the necessary context and detailed explanations that are crucial for a comprehensive understanding and meaningful engagement with the code examples provided here.

## Mosaic Tiles Overview

Each mosaic tile represents a chapter in the book and a stage in the application development process. Here's a brief overview of what each tile covers:

### Mosaic Tile 1: Setting Up the Stage - Ideation and Boards (Chapter 12)
We start by crafting the ideation boards, laying the groundwork for the application. This tile emphasizes the importance of planning and agile development.

### Mosaic Tile 2: Blueprint Bonanza - Design with Open Tools (Chapter 13)
Focuses on the design phase, using open tools to create the application's blueprint. This is where the visual and structural design of the application begins to take shape.

### Mosaic Tile 3: Data - Delve Deeper (Chapter 14)
Connects the application with Azure SQL, including setting up the database and configuring connection strings. Prerequisites include having an Azure account and familiarity with SQL Server.

### Mosaic Tile 4: Backend Ballet - .NET Core Choreography (Chapter 15)
Develops the backend using .NET Core, integrating the database with the application. Ensure to update the `appsettings.json` or `web.config` with your connection strings obtained in Mosaic Tile 3.

### Mosaic Tile 5: Frontend Finish - Angular (Chapter 16)
Brings the frontend to life with Angular, connecting it to the .NET Core API. Apply CORS in the .NET application and adjust service endpoints in Angular to match your development environment.

### Mosaic Tile 6: Visionary Vistas - Data Visualization with DevExtreme (Chapter 17)
Integrates DevExtreme for data visualization. Note that DevExtreme may require a license for commercial use, so review its licensing terms for your project.

### Mosaic Tile 7: Integration Ingenuity (Chapter 18)
Covers additional integration techniques and tools that enhance the application's functionality and user experience. This tile focuses on learning and experimentation.

### Cornerstone: Azure/AWS Deployment (Chapter 19)
Concludes with deploying the application using Azure or AWS, providing YAML code for CI/CD pipelines. Update CORS, connection strings, and service URLs for production environments before deployment.

## Getting Started

To begin working with the AI Dashboard Web Application, navigate to the [AI Dashboard Web Application](./ZippedCode/) folder, where you will find the complete application code. Follow the README within the folder for detailed setup and deployment instructions.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools and accounts set up:
- Azure or AWS account for deployment
- SQL Server for the database
- .NET SDK for backend development
- Angular CLI for frontend development

## Contributing

We welcome contributions and suggestions to improve the application and its documentation. Please refer to the CONTRIBUTING.md file for guidelines on making contributions.

Thank you for joining us in crafting the mosaic of modern software development practices. Your journey through "CodeMosaic" is not just about building an application but understanding the philosophy and practices that make software development a continuously evolving art.
