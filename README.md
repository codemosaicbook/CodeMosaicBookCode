# CodeMosaic: Learn AI-Driven Development and Modern Best Practices for Enterprise

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for "CodeMosaic: Learn AI-Driven Development and Modern Best Practices for Enterprise." This repository serves as a companion to the book, providing readers with code examples, exercises, and full project setups discussed throughout the book.

## About the Book

"CodeMosaic" is a comprehensive guide that explores the intersection of AI-driven development and modern best practices within the enterprise software development landscape. The book is structured into two main parts: theoretical foundations and practical application. Through this dual approach, readers gain a deep understanding of the history, concepts, and technologies shaping today's software development practices, alongside hands-on experience building a full-stack Angular application.

## Repository Structure

This repository is divided into two primary sections, mirroring the book's structure:

- [Part 1: Theoretical Foundations](./Part1/) - Covers the theoretical aspects of software development, including history, full-stack development, Agile methodologies, and more. Selected chapters include practical code examples to illustrate key concepts.
- [Part 2: Practical Application](./Part2/) - Focuses on the step-by-step construction of a full-stack Angular application, demonstrating modern development practices and deployment strategies.

## Installation and Prerequisites

Before diving into the code examples and projects, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Git (for cloning this repository)
- Node.js and npm (for JavaScript-based projects)
- .NET SDK (for .NET examples)
- Angular CLI (for Angular projects)
- SQL Server (for database examples)

Refer to the README.md files within each part and chapter folder for specific setup instructions and dependencies required to run the individual examples and projects.

## Navigation Guide

- **Part 1: Theoretical Foundations** includes chapters that lay the groundwork for understanding modern software development. Not all chapters include code examples, but those that do are designed to reinforce the theoretical concepts discussed.
  - Chapters with code examples are structured with their own README.md files, providing detailed instructions on how to engage with the exercises and assignments.

- **Part 2: Practical Application** takes you through the creation of a real-world application. This section is rich with code and includes a comprehensive README.md to guide you through setup, development, and deployment processes.


Thank you for joining us on this journey to explore AI-driven development and modern best practices for enterprise software development. Happy coding!
